1. Functions to construct a n<sup>2</sup> x n<sup>2</sup> sparse matrix
    * Create a block matrix of n x n blocks with -4 in the diagonal and 1 above and below the diagonal. All other values should be 0
    * Create a block matrix of n x n blocks with 1 in the diagonal
    * Combine the two block matrices to an n<sup>2</sup> x n<sup>2</sup> matrix A
    * Visualize and check if the matrix was constructed correctly automatically
    * Construct a vector b of size n<sup>2</sup> x 1
