# Steady State Heat Flow

For this project we generated a class to hold the code for the steady state heat flow project. The file HeatModel.py holds all the code for the class, including:
* Base Constructor
* Design Matrix Construction
* Target Vector Construction
* Design Matrix and Target Vector Visualization
* Gauss Seidel Iterative Solver
* Jacobi Iterative Solver
* Solution Visualizer

An example on how to drive the class, along with a visual solution, will be included in example.ipynb. Each method has what we believe to be sufficient comments and white space to be easily read and understood.
